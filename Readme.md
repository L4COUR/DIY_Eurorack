# DIY Eurorack Modules

In this repository I have tried to document my approach to DIY eurorack. I want this repository to reflect my creative process and learning of electronic audio circuits and be available as a resource for other people that like myself has no electronical engineering background buts still like to tinker around with electronics and modular synth equipment.

## Getting started

Before getting started with making DIY eurorack modules I would recommend that you make or buy a eurorack case and power supply, and maybe a mixer and VCO module so you already how a way of producing sound in the eurorack format.

If you have no experience with electronics I would recommend buying an Arduino starter kit and exploring simple circuits with LED's first, since having a basic understanding of common electronics is very important in terms of reading schematics, troubleshooting etc.

Of course you will also need to invest some money in components for each build along with other materials like wood, wires and soldering irons and breadboards.

## Making a eurorack prototyping panel (optional)

In this section we will be looking at how to make a panel with the correct eurorack dimensions. You will need access to a lasercutter or CNC machine, wood, and a program that can draw or handle .svg files

Go to http://www.doepfer.de/a100_man/a100m_e.htm, in order to get the correct dimensions for your panel. In my own process I wanted to make a panel big enough for having a breadboard mounted on the surface, so I went with a module width of 12 HP, which meant an actual module width of 60.60 mm, the standard eurorack height is 3 U or 128.5 mm, this is the same no matter what width you want your module to be.

in terms of thickness doepfer recommends to go with about 2 mm, but just make sure that the machine you use to cut your material can handle the small thickness you settle on, or have available.
